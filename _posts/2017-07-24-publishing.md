excerpt: "Scientific Publishing"

With this post, I just wanted to collect a couple ideas about the world of scientific publishing, having been involved in it for a little while and not too long ago now. by now, everybody knows (or should know) by now that this world is fundamentally broken and at harmful for research, but I thought I'd give my two cents anyway. 

What essentially makes for a researcher is the creative attitude towards his job. In an ideal world, a researcher is someone driven purely by the famous "thirst for knowledge", only interested in learning new things for the sake of it and to contribute to a better world. In reality though, researchers these days have to spent a ridicolous amount of time in paperwork, adminy tasks, politics and the way scientific publishing has developed just makes things painful.
