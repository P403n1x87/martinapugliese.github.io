Actually, at the time of writing this, I've already escaped you and moved to Edinburgh. Yea, that happened one week ago, I'm sorry Glasgow.

You've been very good to me during the (about) year and a half we've been together, and I've genuinely appreciated your company. I loved your authenticity.
I know, I know, you're about to say I've left you for the rich guy. 

I have no good arguments to counterattack this, it's true. This thing has been going on for a while just now and going back and forth between you guys was frankly becoming exhausting. 

So, I'm going to shut up here and just remember a bit of the good times we've had together.
