Actually, at the time of writing this, I've already escaped you and moved to Edinburgh. Yea, that happened one week ago, I'm sorry Glasgow.

You've been very good to me during the (about) year and a half we've been together, and I've genuinely appreciated your company. I loved your authenticity.
I know, I know, you're about to say I've left you for the rich guy. 

I have no good arguments to counterattack this, it's true. This thing has been going on for a while just now and going back and forth between you guys was frankly becoming exhausting. 

So, I'm going to shut up here and just remember a bit of the good times we've had together. 

People say you're ugly, but under the right light, you look just majestic

And you know how to make someone smile ![manfield1]

The affogato at your Avenue Coffee is just great. I loved it every time, to the point that it's been the only thing I've ever had in that place. You know I stick to the stuff I like. [avenue-coffee]

See, we always had a problem, the drinking one. You drink too much Glasgow. You made me try the finest beers around but see, I just don't have a taste for alcohol. It's not my fault. I'm not sure I'm going to solve this problem now (something tells me that I won't), but look, you definitely had too much of a habit for me. ![shilling]

You make a mean pizza (and, as you know, I understand about good pizza) ![paesano]

You're home to a very yummy Greek restaurant ![yamas]

I like you, even when you pretended you could speak Italian ![cappaccino]
