Actually, at the time of writing this, I've already moved on, changed address, left no trace. I moved to Edinburgh. Yea, that happened one week ago.
You must have noticed by now. Yea, I've been a coward. And yea, I hear you, I escaped to the rich guy. I didn't have the heart to tell you before.

I know there is a fight between you two. You have a certain reputation, Glasgow, and I loved everything about it, from the very start. When you ask people around, they will tell you that you, Glasgow, are the *authentic* one and Edinburgh is the *postcard-like* one (if they're on your side). If they're on the other side, I'm not completely sure what they'd say about you. No, I'm not trying to be nice and sugar-coat the truth, you know I don't do that. And I've so much appreciated when you didn't do that with me either.

I went to the rich guy. I went to the pretty guy. I feel so bad. But see, things weren't going to end well: this has been going on for a while just now (you knew) and honestly, going back and forth between you guys is exhausting. I have to have a life, you know. Don't let me expand too much on the reasons why, I already feel too bad and you wouldn't get any benefit out of it.

So, I'm going to shut up here and just remember a bit of the many good times we've had together. 

You've been very good to me during the (about) year and a half we've been together. I'll always remember this time of my life, it's been grand!

People say you're "rough". No offence (I know you care for your manly reputation), but I think I've seen rougher types. Or maybe you only ever showed me your gentle face. 

![glasgow-uni] People say you're "ugly", especially because they (maybe unconsciously) compare you to Edinburgh, but under the right light, you look just majestic.

Look at the Main Building tower of the University (of Glasgow). This picture of you I've taken on the very first of our dates, remember that?

We both know the "right light" is not something you can take for granted at yours, but hey, when it's there, it's just fantastic.

And when the sun starts to set after a good day, it's just magic at the Kelvingrove. You have to value what you have, and it's sadly true that you appreciate stuff more when it becomes scarce.

![kelvingrove] Speaking of the Kelvingrove, you supported and accommodated my quirky tendency to switch among emotions, you even went as far as modifying yourself, via a rather temperamental weather.

You know how to make someone smile ![manfield1]

The affogato at your Avenue Coffee is just great. I loved it every time, to the point that it's been the only thing I've ever had in that place. You know I stick to the stuff I like. ![avenue-coffee]

See, we always had a problem, the drinking one. You drink too much Glasgow. You made me try the finest beers around but see, I just don't have a taste for alcohol. It's not my fault. I'm not sure I'm going to solve this problem now (something tells me that I won't), but look, you definitely had too much of a habit for me. ![shilling]

You make a mean pizza (and, as you know, I understand about good pizza) ![paesano]

You're home to a very yummy Greek restaurant ![yamas]

I've liked you, even when you pretended you could speak Italian ![cappaccino]
